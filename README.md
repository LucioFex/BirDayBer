# BirDayBer

### BirDayBer (an abbreviation for "Birthday Reminder") is an application made for people who forget the birthdays of their friends or families like me ðŸ˜….

It allows you to add the date of birth and other minimal information to a local database. Then the program will take care of calculating the dates for you.

This project will remind you with a notification for your operating system if it is someone's birthday on the same day or it will notify you if it's soon.
